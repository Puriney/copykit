# CopyKit

  **CopyKit** provides a toolkit for the analysis of single-cell copy number datasets. It includes functions to read data from [Varbin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417119/) or [10X CNA datasets](https://www.10xgenomics.com/solutions/single-cell-cnv/).
  
  A common workflow with **CopyKit** consists in reading the dataset and using to filter the noisy cells out, clustering and plotting heatmaps for further analysis.

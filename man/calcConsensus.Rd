\item{scCNA}{The scCNA object.}

\item{assay}{String with the name of the assay to pull data from to calculate
the consensus matrix.}

\item{consensus_by}{A string with the column from colData that will be used
to isolate the cells by factor and calculate the consensus.}

should be parallelized.}

\description{
Calculate a consensus matrix of segment means based on \code{colData}
}
\details{
Consensus profiles are calculated by averaging or taking the median
 of the ith segment mean of all single cells assigned to the same element of
 \link{colData},
}

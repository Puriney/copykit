<!-- badges: end -->

**CopyKit** provides a toolkit for the analysis of single-cell copy
number datasets. It includes functions to read data from
[Varbin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417119/) or [10X
CNA datasets](https://www.10xgenomics.com/solutions/single-cell-cnv/).

A common workflow with **CopyKit** consists in reading the dataset and
using to filter the noisy cells out, clustering and plotting heatmaps
for further analysis.

## Installation
